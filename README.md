Kill All is a mobile game for Android in which players tap on objects on the screen to destroy them within a set time limit. As levels progress, object speed, destruction difficulty, and counts increase, challenging the player further. The game features a currency system ("gold") earned through missions and rewards, which can be used for unlocking new object skins. Users can manage missions, adjust settings, and browse achievements through a straightforward in-game interface. The repository provides a clear package structure, class breakdown, user manual, development challenges, and testing notes to aid further development and user support.
